<br>
<br>Prerequisites
<br>Before we get started, make sure you have the following:
<br>
<br>A wallet connected to the Polygon network
<br>A small amount of ETH in the wallet to pay for gas fees
<br>Step-by-Step Guide
<br>Connect to Polygon network using your wallet provider (e.g. MetaMask)
<br>Bungee supports all leading wallets such as Metamask, Wallet Connect, Rainbow and Coinbase wallet.
<br>
<br>3. Go to the Bungee.exchange website and select “Polygon” as from chain and “Optimism” as to chain from the drop downs
<br>
<br>4. Select the asset you want to bridge (e.g. USDC)
<br>
<br>5. Enter the amount you want to bridge and click on “Review Route”
<br>
<br>
<br>6. Confirm the transaction on your wallet provider
<br>
<br>7. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Polygon network
<br>
<br>8. Connect to Optimism network using your wallet provider
<br>
<br>9. Wait for the bridged asset to appear in your Optimism wallet
<br>
<br>That’s it! You have successfully bridged assets from Polygon to Optimism network using Bungee protocol.
<br>
<br>About Polygon
<br>Polygon (also known as Matic Network) is a decentralized platform that is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to provide fast, cheap, and secure transactions for developers building on Ethereum.
<br>
<br>About Optimism
<br>Optimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain. Built as a minimal extension to existing Ethereum software, Optimism’s EVM-equivalent architecture scales your Ethereum apps without surprises. If it works on Ethereum, it works on Optimism at a fraction of the cost.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>Bridging between different blockchain networks can be a complex process, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be done easily. Bungee provides the cheapest, fastest and most secure way to bridge assets between Polygon and Optimism networks.<br><br></p>
